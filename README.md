This repository is for the course project of COMP4211 in HKUST.

## Project overview
The task of this project is essentially to perform image classification for the Wonders dataset, which is a common task in the field of Computer Vision. However, the focus of this project lies not in the model performance, such as accuracy, F1 score, etc., but the technique of transfer learning.
